### TOWARD AN ARTIFICIAL COGNITIVE MODEL TO ASSIST CAREGIVERS IN DECISION-MAKING FOR PERSONS LIVING WITH DEMENTIA

## ABSTRACT

Dementia is a term used to describe a collection of neurodegenerative disorders that impact 
people across the world. The most common neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer, 
which accounted for two-thirds to three-fourths of all cases. The symptoms of the disease 
progression includes recent memory loss and impairment of cognitive functions that create 
challenges to individuals living with dementia performing daily tasks, making them 
dependent on caregivers. Due to social and economic matters, caregivers can be either 
professional or informal, and in some cases, they are members of the patient’s family. 
Investigations suggest that caring for individuals living with neurodegenerative disease is 
stressful physically, mentally, and emotionally. The task repetition associated with other 
situations might result in overload or bad life quality. This study aims to suggest a model of 
an artificial cognitive system to assist caregivers in dementia care. In addition, this model 
assists through an agent personalized support to the decision-making of informal 
caregivers. The methodology applied was systematic review (SR) to gather information and 
design science research (DSR) to develop the experiment. The SR indicated a major part 
of results was published by European (58%) and North American (26%) countries. We also 
noticed an increasing number of results in recent years, we concluded that the recent 
advancements of artificial intelligence and neural networks have raised technology for 
healthcare in academic works. Although there is an apparent increase in the number of 
studies, there is an absence of tentative to application of an artificial cognitive architecture 
in dementia care, which corroborates with the belief that this is still a cutting-edge 
technology and this study has a novel interdisciplinary area. Our proof-of-concept handled 
the data of the patient to provide information from reliable sources, such as Alzheimer’s 
association, to non-professional caregiver’s decision-making regardless of the disease 
stage. However, it is in a nascent state of development and requires further research to be 
applied in real scenarios.

Keywords: artificial cognitive system, decision-making, dementia, caregivers.
